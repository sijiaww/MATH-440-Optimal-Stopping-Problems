# Optimal Stopping Problems with Applications to Finance

## Instructors
- Guillermo Alonso Alvarez
- Yuqiong Wang

## Introduction
This project introduces students to the theory and applications of optimal stopping problems, specifically focusing on financial applications. 
Optimal stopping is a branch of stochastic control that involves deciding on the best time to take particular actions to maximize expected 
gains or minimize expected losses. This is particularly relevant in financial contexts such as asset pricing, real option evaluations, and 
investment timing decisions. By the end of this project, students will have a thorough understanding of both discrete and continuous optimal 
stopping problems, will explore concrete financial examples, and will develop skills in numerical techniques for obtaining solutions.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Stopping Theory in Discrete Time

### 2. Stopping Theory in Continuous Time

### 3. Real World Financial Examples

### 4. Numerical Experiments
