## Introduction
This project introduces the theory and applications of optimal stopping problems, specifically focusing on financial applications. 
Optimal stopping is a branch of stochastic control that involves deciding on the best time to take particular actions to maximize expected 
gains or minimize expected losses. This is particularly relevant in financial contexts such as asset pricing, real option evaluations, and 
investment timing decisions. 

## Project Objectives

### 1. Stopping Theory in Discrete Time
We begin our exploration of optimal stopping problems by delving into the discrete time framework, where we introduce foundational concepts such as the dynamic programming principle and the backward induction method. 

### 2. Stopping Theory in Continuous Time
Transitioning to continuous time analysis, we expand our discussion to include advanced topics like Snell envelopes, free-boundary problems, and the guess and verify approach, alongside recalling the Feynman-Kac theorem to illustrate the deep mathematical connections within these problems.

### 3. Real World Financial Examples
Using the tools we learned, we will then look at some real-world financial examples, such as pricing American options and the optimal consumption problem, perhaps
some exotic options if time permits. And try to solve these examples explicitly and understand how to make timely decisions under uncertainty in finance.

### 4. Numerical Experiments
